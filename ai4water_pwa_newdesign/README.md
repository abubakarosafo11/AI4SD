# AI for Water – Offline PWA Dashboard (New Design)

This is a mobile-friendly **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for water-quality decision support.

## What it solves
- Handles **galamsey influent ranges** (turbidity up to 1500 NTU, pH 5–9)
- Predicts Pb/As removal and effluent
- Computes **capacity-based media life** that scales with throughput (L/day)
- Shows total treatable volume (L)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## iPhone install
Open in **Safari** → Share → Add to Home Screen.

Offline works after first successful load.
